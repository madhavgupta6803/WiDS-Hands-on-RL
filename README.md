# Hands-on Reinforcement Learning

Hello! Welcome to the github repo for the Winter in Data Science Project: Hands-on Reinforcement Learning :)

All the material that will be covered in the project will be outlined here. You can treat this like a map to the project.

The most important book that you will be needing for reinforcement learning will be [Sutton and Barto](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf).

The part-wise content is in the respective folders.

* [Part 1](./part1/)
* [Part 2](./part2/)

## Note

Note that for the completion of the WiDS project, a report is necessary. While the report format is up to you, we recommend writing the report using LaTeX. This can essentially be where you note down things which you do on a weekly basis. For the lit review people, this report should preferably be in a paper format (for instance, [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), or [APS REVTeX](https://journals.aps.org/revtex/revtex-faq#u1)). Other people can also follow this.
