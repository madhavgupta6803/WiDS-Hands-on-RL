# Part 3

In this part we will cover content that will help us in going ahead and implementing RL in (simplified) real life situations.

We have looked at dynamic programming for solving MDPs, and familiarized ourselves with the notions of prediction and control in MDPs. 

Now, we will move forward with the algorithms for doing the latter. To do: 

- The chapter on Monte Carlo Methods from Sutton and Barto (Chapter 5)
- (Optional) The next chapter on TD learning.
- Lectures [15](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2022/lectures/cs747a2022l15.pdf) and [16](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2022/lectures/cs747a2022l16.pdf) from the CS 747 course: Segway into SARSA, Q-Learning, and Expected-SARSA.
